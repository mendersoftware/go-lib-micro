Mender: go-lib-micro
==============================================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains the Mender go-lib-micro library, which is part of the
Mender server. The Mender server is designed as a microservices architecture
and comprises several repositories.

The go-lib-micro library is a collection of utilities and middlewares shared among microservices in the Mender ecosystem.
